**Webpage:** https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?dswid=5201&dsrid=179

**Content:** In the Advanced IR course we revisit some of the basic models of the Grundlagen des IR (188.977) course but go both deeper (learning to implement our own search system from scratch) and broader (looking at statistical semantics methods for learning the meaning of text, at distributed/federated search systems, and much more). Having previously attended  Grundlagen des IR is not mandatory and all students will be brought up to date with the basics of Search Technology.

**Presentation:** The presentation introduces the research field of *Music Information Retrieval* as well as the particularities of audio and music processing in an information retrieval context.
